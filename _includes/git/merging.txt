# Didn't let you do it? No problem, it probably means that your
# branch is out of date. In other words, master has been updated
# since you originally branched off of it.

# Whoa, did you just force push and re-write history?
# Ya, I did. At Pixel Union a branch is your own. You own it. It's your baby.
# If somebody was working on your branch, you'd know about it because they
# would have talked to you.

# Special note: never re-write master's history.
